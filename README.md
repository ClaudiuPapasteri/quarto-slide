# quarto-slide - Quarto Reveal.js Boilerplate

### Description:

This is a Quarto Reveal.js Template that showcase the most important features I use in my slides.

Using Github Pages doesn't render the presentation correctly if it is not self-contained HTML: https://claudiupapasteri.github.io/quarto-slide/quarto-slide.html#/

To render them correctly use self-contained HTML (setting embed-resources: true and disabling Chalkboard plugin that conflicts with it).

You can find the rendered presentation here: https://claudiupapasteri.github.io/quarto-slide/e-quarto-slide.html#/
